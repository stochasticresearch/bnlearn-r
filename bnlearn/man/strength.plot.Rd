\title{Arc strength plot}
\description{

  Plot a Bayesian network and format its arcs according to the strength of the
  dependencies they represent. Requires the \pkg{Rgraphviz} package.

}
\usage{
strength.plot(x, strength, threshold, cutpoints, highlight = NULL,
  layout = "dot", shape = "circle", main = NULL, sub = NULL, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{bn}.}
  \item{strength}{an object of class \code{bn.strength} computed from the object
    of class \code{bn} corresponding to the \code{x} parameter.}
  \item{threshold}{a numeric value. See below.}
  \item{cutpoints}{an array of numeric values. See below.}
  \item{highlight}{a list, see \code{\link{graphviz.plot}} for details.}
  \item{layout}{a character string, the layout parameter to be passed to 
    \pkg{Rgraphviz}. Possible values are \code{dots}, \code{neato},
    \code{twopi}, \code{circo} and \code{fdp}. See \pkg{Rgraphviz} documentation
    for details.}
  \item{shape}{a character string, the shape of the nodes. Can be \code{circle},
    \code{ellipse} or \code{rectangle}.}
  \item{main}{a character string, the main title of the graph. It's plotted at
    the top of the graph.}
  \item{sub}{a character string, a subtitle which is plotted at the bottom of
    the graph.}
  \item{debug}{a boolean value. If \code{TRUE} a lot of debugging output is
    printed; otherwise the function is completely silent.}
}
\details{

  The \code{threshold} parameter is used to determine which arcs are supported
  strongly enough by the data to be deemed significant:
  \itemize{
    \item if arc strengths have been computed using conditional independence
      tests, any strength coefficient (which is the p-value of the test) lesser
      or equal than the threshold is considered significant. In this case the
      default value of \code{threshold} is equal to the value of the
      \code{alpha} parameter used in the call to \code{arc.strength}, which in
      turn defaults to the one used by the learning algorithm (if any) or to
      \code{0.05}.
    \item if arc strengths have been computed using network scores, any strength
      coefficient (which is the increase/decrease of the network score caused by
      the removal of the arc) lesser than the threshold is considered
      significant. In this case the default value of \code{threshold} is
      \code{0}.
    \item if arc strengths have been computed using bootstrap, any strength
      coefficient (which is the relative frequency of the arc in the networks
      learned from the bootstrap replicates) greater or equal than the threshold
      is considered significant. In this case the default value of
      \code{threshold} is \code{0.5}.
  }

  Non-significant arcs are plotted as dashed lines.

  The \code{cutpoints} parameter is an array of numeric values used to divide
  the range of the strength coefficients into intervals. The interval each
  strength coefficient falls into determines the line width of the corresponding
  arc in the plot. The default intervals are delimited by

    \code{  unique(c(0, threshold/c(10, 5, 2, 1.5, 1), 1))}

  if the coefficients are computed from conditional independence tests, by

    \code{  1 - unique(c(0, threshold/c(10, 5, 2, 1.5, 1), 1))}

  for bootstrap estimates or by the quantiles

    \code{  quantile(-s[s < threshold], c(0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 0.95, 1))}

  of the significant coefficients if network scores are used.

  The object of class \code{graphAM} used to format and render the plot. It can
  be further modified using the commands present in the \pkg{graph} and
  \pkg{Rgraphviz} packages.
