\title{Discover the structure around a single node}
\description{

  Learn the Markov blanket or the neighbourhood centered on a node.

}
\usage{
learn.mb(x, node, method, whitelist = NULL, blacklist = NULL, start = NULL,
  test = NULL, alpha = 0.05, B = NULL, debug = FALSE)
learn.nbr(x, node, method, whitelist = NULL, blacklist = NULL,
  test = NULL, alpha = 0.05, B = NULL, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a data frame containing the variables in the model.}
  \item{node}{a character string, the label of the node whose local structure
    is being learned.}
  \item{method}{a character string, the label of a structure learning algorithm.
    Possible choices are \link{constraint-based algorithms} for \code{learn.mb}
    and \link{local discovery algorithms} for \code{learn.nbr}.}
  \item{whitelist}{a vector of character strings, the labels of the whitelisted
    nodes.}
  \item{blacklist}{a vector of character strings, the labels of the blacklisted
    nodes.}
  \item{start}{a vector of character strings, the labels of the nodes to be
    included in the Markov blanket before the learning process (in
    \code{learn.mb}). Note that the nodes in \code{start} can be removed from
    the Markov blanket by the learning algorithm, unlike the nodes included due
    to whitelisting.}
  \item{test}{a character string, the label of the conditional independence test
    to be used in the algorithm. If none is specified, the default test statistic
    is the \emph{mutual information} for categorical variables, the 
    Jonckheere-Terpstra test for ordered factors and the \emph{linear
    correlation} for continuous variables. See \code{\link{bnlearn-package}} for
    details.}
  \item{alpha}{a numeric value, the target nominal type I error rate.}
  \item{B}{a positive integer, the number of permutations considered for each
    permutation test. It will be ignored with a warning if the conditional
    independence test specified by the \code{test} argument is not a permutation
    test.}
  \item{debug}{a boolean value. If \code{TRUE} a lot of debugging output is 
    printed; otherwise the function is completely silent.}
}
\value{

  A vector of character strings, the labels of the nodes in the Markov blanket
  (for \code{learn.mb}) or in the neighbourhood (for \code{learn.nbr}).
